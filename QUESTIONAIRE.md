<!-- Briefly describe what makes a good developer and what you enjoy most about software
development. -->

What makes a good developer is based on tenacity and their ability to communicate. If your just starting out or you're at the senior level for a multibillion dollar company you have to be able to accept that things are eventually not go as planned, you're going to fail, fall short, or hit a wall and you are going to be challanged. How you adapt to those short comings and challanges is what seperates from being average to being good. 

Which is why being a good communicator works hand in hand with the tenacity aspect. If you can effectively communicate your problems, concerns, or dislikes with your team and others your work with around you find the challanges much easier to face when everyone is on the same page and working towards the same common goal. 

<!-- How do you know you are writing quality code and that your code is working? What do you look
for when reviewing code other people write? -->

Writing quality code takes practice and disipline. There are so many aspects to the formula but some that I try to stick with is staying neat, uniform, and making constant commits and necessary branches to back up not only the work your doing now , but the work you have previously done in the past.

Staying neat is keeping your code "in-line" (however you choose to do that), including proper spacing and line breaks to make the file as easy to read as possible.

Keeping your code consistant also helps you keep you code neat and easy to read by using the same punctuation (semicolons vs no semicolons / single vs double quotes) and uniform syntax ("easy to understand", named variables / camel casing where appropiate).

Lastly making proper branches, pushes, and commits to back up your work using GitHub helps preventing you from loosing work or your team not working on the correct version and creating huge problems that can be avoided. 

<!-- Tell us about a time you made an error and broke something or tell us about a time when you
found something someone else broke. How did you bring that to your team? How did you
communicate with the person who made an error? How was the error fixed? -->

<!-- Tell us about a time you had to work one-on-one with someone to solve a problem.Â How did you
solve it, what did you learn about working with someone that way? -->
