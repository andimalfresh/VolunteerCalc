<!-- Briefly describe what makes a good developer and what you enjoy most about software
development. -->

Two things I believe make a good developer are tenacity and the ability to communicate. If your just starting out or you're at the senior level for a multibillion dollar company you have to be able to accept that things are eventually not go as planned, you're going to fail, fall short, or hit a wall and you are going to be challenged. How you adapt to those shortcomings and challenges is what separates from being average to being good.

Which is why being a good communicator works hand in hand with the tenacity aspect. If you can effectively communicate your problems or concerns with your team and others whom you work with you'll find the challenges much easier to face when everyone is on the same page and working towards the same common goal.

<!-- How do you know you are writing quality code and that your code is working? What do you look
for when reviewing code other people write? -->

Writing quality code takes practice and discipline. There are so many aspects to the formula but some that I try to stick with is staying neat, uniform, and making constant commits and necessary branches to back up not only the work your doing now, but the work you have previously done in the past.

Staying neat is keeping your code "in-line" including proper spacing and line breaks to make the file as easy to read as possible.

Keeping your code consistent also helps you keep you code neat and easy to read by using the same punctuation (semicolons vs no semicolons / single vs double quotes) and uniform syntax ("easy to understand", named variables / camel casing where appropriate).

Lastly making proper branches, pushes, and commits to back up your work using GitHub helps preventing you from losing work or your team not working on the correct version and creating huge problems that can be avoided.

There are many ways to check if your code is working: While running the application is a good way to start there are other methods one should consider as well. Utilizing Test Driven Development practices is a great way to ensure that your code is written properly and not breaking.

Another method I use to make sure that I am writing quality working code is to break it into smaller parts. Say there is a function I am trying to write but not sure exactly how to make it work. I will create a similar function in a Repl or a JSFiddle to make sure I have the core idea of what I am trying to
write working before I add more complex elements and data into what I am working on.

When reviewing others code I like to compare how I think I would write something similar and then try
and figure out why that person wrote it differently if that's the case. Often you can find ways to write
cleaner and better code yourself by learning patterns and practices others use.

<!-- Tell us about a time you made an error and broke something or tell us about a time when you
found something someone else broke. How did you bring that to your team? How did you
communicate with the person who made an error? How was the error fixed? -->

A Few times at my previous job things would go overlooked or miscommunicated by my team, or we'd be so overwhelmingly busy (SkiTown/Christmas Break/StarWars premiere week) the wheels would just fall off our operation seemingly. As a manager in dealing with a disaster, an irate guest, or a mistake caused by a coworker I would remain calm and collected. If time allowed I would address the problem or mistake immediately and explain why it's important not to make those mistakes future occurrences. By keeping my composure I would set an example that would allow us as a team to rally behind a solution and move forward in a positive manner, rather than dwelling who was at fault.

<!-- Tell us about a time you had to work one-on-one with someone to solve a problem. How did you
solve it, what did you learn about working with someone that way? -->

For our Project Galvanize Unity we had to create a full stack application in 3 days using Agile and Pair Programming processes. After planning our project with my team my teachers told me I couldn't write any of the back end of the project until the final day. This set up the opportunity to  work on pair programming the backend with Meredith Fontana who was not as adept at building databases as I was at that time.Iit was
a great exercise in not only communication but explaining the fundamentals of using KNEX and POSTGRESQL. "navigating" the project and doing no "driving"/coding allowed me to solidify processes like migrations and routes due to verbally explaining out each step and the reasons behind the code which in turn made us both stronger developers.
